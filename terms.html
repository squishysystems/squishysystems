                    <h2>Terms and Conditions</h2>
                    <h3>A collaboration with Angela Lorenzo in which we printed the terms and conditions for each computer program we used over the course of a week. By translating the terms from their native digital space, users were no longer be able to swiftly scroll through the statements and were confronted with the termsâ€™ length and content. However, even with the tangibility, the viewer quickly realizes that the texts are ultimately legal documents full of impenetrable jargon. The list of companies named on the protruding timestamps are all too familiar, highlighting that declining these terms means declining engagement with many integral elements of RISD and society at-large.</h3>
