                    <h2> Top Heavy Typeface</h2>
                    <h3> What if the laws of gravity were applied to typography? Top Heavy re-situates each letterform from Cotham Sans, an open source typeface designed by Sebastien Sanfilippo, based on how it would fall if dropped from a low height. To prevent a collection of 52 faceplanted characters, I simulated a depth equivalent to the width of each character's stroke, extruding it into a proportional three-dimensional structure.</h3>
                    <h3>Many characters needed to be raised above the baseline first: those with descenders were obvious victims, but characters with rounded bottoms that fall ever so slightly below the ground were raised as well. By noting these small changes, I offer graphic designers a way to reconsider the planes of typography and clue in outsiders to the tiny details of type design.</h3>
